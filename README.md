# LibraryManagementSystem-Backend



# Project Description:

The Library Management System (LMS) Backend is a robust and feature-rich system designed to streamline and automate library operations. Built using Spring Boot and integrating various cutting-edge technologies,
this backend system provides a comprehensive set of APIs for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on library resources. 
Below are the key highlights of this project:


# Spring Boot Framework:

The project is developed using the Spring Boot framework, which offers a powerful and flexible platform for building Java-based web applications. Spring Boot simplifies the development process and promotes best practices in application design.



# Hibernate:

Hibernate, a widely-used Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, is seamlessly integrated into the system. It ensures efficient and database-agnostic data storage, retrieval, and management.

MySQL Database: The backend uses a MySQL database for data storage. MySQL is known for its reliability, performance, and scalability, making it an ideal choice for managing library-related data.


# Postman for API Testing: 

To ensure the reliability and functionality of the APIs, Postman is employed for thorough testing. Postman provides a user-friendly interface for testing endpoints, making it easy to validate API responses.

# Lombok Library: 
The project showcases the usage of Lombok, a library that simplifies Java code by reducing boilerplate code for common tasks, such as getters, setters, and constructors. 
It enhances code readability and maintainability.

# Swagger Documentation:

Swagger is integrated into the project to automatically generate API documentation. It provides clear and interactive documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and utilize the available APIs.

# Real-time Email Notifications: 

One of the standout features of this system is its ability to send real-time email notifications when a book is issued to a student. 
This feature enhances user experience and ensures timely communication between the library and its patrons.



The Library Management System Backend is designed to offer efficiency, reliability, and scalability in managing library resources and operations. With its rich feature set and modern technologies, it empowers libraries to provide excellent services to their users while simplifying administrative tasks.

This backend system can serve as a strong foundation for developing a full-fledged Library Management System, incorporating user interfaces and additional features as needed.
